Open all external links in your blog posts and pages automatically in a new tab or new window when clicked or tapped.

== Description ==

This plugin will solve the problem of manually changing all your external links to open in a new window by doing it automatically for you...for all external links in all posts and pages!

This plugin uses standard HTML and doesn't introduce any more JavaScript into your already JavaScript heavy WordPress site. It also uses very minimal styling (CSS) to display a new window icon, which is embedded and not externally linked.

The display of the new window icon can be changed in the settings page and you can also add the `rel="nofollow"` attribute (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow).

Updates to the plugin will be posted on the Etalented website (https://etalented.co.uk/wordpress-plugin-external-links-to-new-window) as well as to the WordPress.org Plugin Directory (https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/external-links-to-new-window/).

This plugin was originally created by Christopher Ross (http://thisismyurl.com) and is now maintained by Etalented (https://etalented.co.uk).
